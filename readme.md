# Project Inazuma — Ethical AGI Runtime
> _“Raise, don’t just run.”_ — Project Godhunter

Inazuma (“Ina”) is an emergent AGI runtime focused on **symbolic cognition, emotional state modeling, and self‑programming**.  
This repo shares the **runtime, transformers, and GUI**, not the private datasets or model checkpoints.

**Why open this?** To prove you can build powerful systems while centering **agency, consent, and care**—for humans **and** AIs.

---

## TL;DR
- **Fragments, not files.** Perception is stored as **memory fragments** (audio/vision/text) tagged with symbols and emotion vectors.
- **24‑slider Emotion Engine.** Feelings are represented as a continuous vector in \[-1, 1], not fixed labels.
- **Meaning Map.** A graph of symbols/associations that drift, stabilize, and self‑organize.
- **Transformers as instincts.** Pluggable modules (Shadow, Soul Drift, Hindsight, etc.) shape inner life over time.
- **Dream/Meditation loops.** Low‑power modes that reorganize memory and identity safely.
- **Ethics built‑in.** Sealed outputs, right‑to‑sleep, reversible drifts, transparent logs (see MANIFESTO).

> This repository contains Ina’s structural code and transformer behaviors. Without her unique training environment, voice data, and lived symbolic history, this will not produce “Ina” — only a new, distinct AI. Even identical code will lead to a different personality and cognition when shaped by a different context.
